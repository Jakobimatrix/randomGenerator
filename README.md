# randomGenerator
Implements a header only singleton class holding a simple to use random generator. I foud that I need this class in nearly every project so I decided to give it its own repository which than can be added as a subrepro rather than copy pasting it every time.

For most simple cases this class is more than enough. I am not sure about multithreading though. A more complex class can be found here: https://github.com/effolkronium/random


# Usage
see `example.cpp`
